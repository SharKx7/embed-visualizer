The beginning of the acquisition was difficult because many changes had to take place. A short time later, a friend of mine, __Celine 'Chihiro_' Rauch__, joined the management team. So many things have been turned upside down in **Mighty eSports** and new things have been rethought. Now we have reached a point where we want to achieve many things. New sponsors, new logo as you can see, new members in the management team or as a member for a game. The team **Mighty eSports**, now consists more than 25 members which we all enjoy very much."
